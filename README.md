# Shibori Agent

Simply run `Shibori Agent`, and send it a prompt.

## Why?

AI Agents are becoming a technological norm and should be a tool in any software professional's tool belt.


### Why `THIS` agent?

AI agents are awesome technologically, but general-purpose agents rarely work as promised for the most part. They tend to error quite often. Mostly due to tasks that require the right environment for such execution.
If the agent gets stuck on a task, this can become an issue where failure can be absolute.


### What this project is not

A magic wand that solves the question: How do we achieve world peace?
